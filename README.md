# FEM
Solving 1 D spring element equations using Finite Element Method in Python. This program focus on one dimensional
spring problem using nodal method. Problem description in the form of total number of nodes and elements are necessary
along with necessary boundary condition of forces and displacements.

Note : Only zero displacement conditions can be solved using this program.

Output of this program is :
1) Global stiffness matrix
2) Global displacement matrix
3) Global force matrix
4) Elemental force matrix


The program can be run in command terminal using python3.

Syntax :
python 1D_spring_analysis.py

Necessary modules for running :
1) numpy

Required files :
1) spring.py (already in the package)
